## üîß Technical Details

### PlayCover External App Installation System

#### Previous Problem
When PlayCover starts with the volume unmounted, data is created in the internal storage container, preventing external volume mounting.

#### Solution
Place PlayCover.app itself on external storage, with only a symbolic link in /Applications:

```bash
# Actual location
~/Library/Containers/io.playcover.PlayCover/PlayCover.app

# Symbolic link
/Applications/PlayCover.app -> ~/Library/Containers/io.playcover.PlayCover/PlayCover.app
```

#### Benefits
- ‚úÖ PlayCover automatically unable to launch when external drive disconnected
- ‚úÖ Spotlight and Launchpad search works normally
- ‚úÖ Complete prevention of internal storage data creation from accidental launch
- ‚úÖ Automatic verification and recreation of symbolic link on mount

### Mount Options
All volumes are mounted with `nobrowse` option, preventing display in Finder sidebar and desktop.

```bash
sudo mount -t apfs -o nobrowse /dev/diskXsY ~/Library/Containers/[BundleID]
```

### Volume Layout
- **PlayCover main volume**: `~/Library/Containers/io.playcover.PlayCover`
- **PlayCover app itself**: `~/Library/Containers/io.playcover.PlayCover/PlayCover.app`
- **App volumes**: `~/Library/Containers/[Each app's BundleID]`

### Auto-Correction Features
Volume management detects volumes mounted at incorrect locations and automatically remounts them correctly. Also automatically detects and repairs broken symbolic links.

### Management via Homebrew
PlayCover itself is installed/uninstalled using official methods:
```bash
# Installation
brew install --cask playcover-community

# Uninstallation (during nuclear cleanup)
brew uninstall --cask playcover-community
```

## üîÑ Storage Mode System (v4.33.x)

### Internal Storage Flag System

**Purpose**: Distinguish between intentional internal storage and unintended contamination.

#### Storage Modes

1. **External Storage Mode** (`external`)
   - Normal operation mode
   - Data stored on external volume
   - Display: üîå External storage mode (blue)

2. **Intentional Internal Storage Mode** (`internal_intentional`)
   - User explicitly switched to internal storage
   - Flag file exists: `.playcover_internal_storage_flag`
   - Volume is locked - cannot mount external volume
   - Display: üè† Internal storage mode (green) / üîí Locked
   - Protection: Prevents accidental mounting over internal data

3. **Contaminated Internal Storage** (`internal_contaminated`)
   - Unintended internal data (PlayCover launched without volume)
   - No flag file present
   - Display: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Internal data detected (orange)
   - Action: Offers cleanup options when mounting

4. **No Data** (`none`)
   - Container is empty
   - Display: ‚ö†Ô∏è No data (gray)

#### Flag Management

**Automatic flag management:**
- Created when switching to internal storage
- Deleted when switching back to external storage
- Checked before all mount operations

**Individual Volume Control:**
- Intentional internal: Refuses to mount, guides to storage switch
- Contaminated: Offers cleanup options with default recommendation

**Batch Mount All:**
- Intentional internal: Shows "‚ö†Ô∏è  This volume is locked" (not counted as failure)
- Contaminated: Shows "‚ùå Mount failed: Data exists in internal storage"
- Summary displays: "Success: X / Failed: Y / Locked: Z"

#### Cleanup Options for Contaminated Data

When contaminated internal data is detected:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Unintended data detected in internal storage

Select processing method:
  1. Prioritize external volume (delete internal data) [Recommended - Default]
  2. Cancel (do not mount)

Selection (1-2) [Default: 1]:
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Requirements
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4 series)
- macOS Sequoia 15.1 (Tahoe 26.0.1) or later
- Full Disk Access permission (Terminal.app)
- External storage (USB/Thunderbolt/SSD)

### Recommendations
- Always mount volumes before using PlayCover
- Always unmount volumes before Mac shutdown
- Run "Eject Entire Disk" before physically removing external storage
- **When external drive disconnected**: PlayCover.app cannot launch due to symbolic link (normal behavior)

### Troubleshooting
- **Volume not found**: Volume Management ‚Üí Status Check
- **Mount error**: Volume Management ‚Üí Individual Control for remount
- **Appears on desktop**: Unmount existing mount and remount
- **App won't launch**: Verify volume is properly mounted
- **Can't launch PlayCover**: Verify external storage is connected
- **Data in internal storage**: Unmount PlayCover volume and delete internal data
- **üî• All apps crashing**: Run nuclear cleanup (see `docs/guides/NUCLEAR_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`)
- **Crashes after remounting external volume**: Use nuclear cleanup to completely delete old data on external volume
