## 🎯 Overview

PlayCover Manager GUI is a complete rewrite of the original CLI-based PlayCover Manager, transforming 9,000+ lines of Zsh scripts into a modern, fully-graphical macOS application built with SwiftUI.

### What It Does

- 🚀 **Quick Launch:** One-click launching of PlayCover apps
- 📦 **App Management:** Install/uninstall iOS apps via IPA files
- 💾 **Storage Switching:** Seamlessly switch between internal and external storage
- 💿 **Volume Management:** Create and manage APFS volumes for app data
- 🔧 **Maintenance:** System cache clearing, APFS snapshot management
- ⚙️ **Settings:** Customizable transfer methods, themes, and notifications

### Why This Exists

PlayCover allows running iOS apps on macOS, but app data can consume significant storage. This app enables:

1. **Storage Flexibility:** Keep app data on external drives to save internal SSD space
2. **Easy Switching:** Move apps between internal and external storage with one click
3. **Automatic Management:** Intelligent storage mode detection and volume management
4. **Beautiful UI:** Native macOS interface with smooth animations and clear feedback

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Pattern: MVVM with Services

```
Views (SwiftUI)
    ↓
ViewModels (@MainActor, ObservableObject)
    ↓
Services (ShellExecutor, PrivilegedOps, Notifications, Errors, Logger)
    ↓
Zsh Scripts (Original CLI backend)
```

### Key Components

**Services:**
- `ShellScriptExecutor`: Execute Zsh commands from Swift
- `PrivilegedOperationManager`: Handle sudo operations
- `NotificationManager`: macOS notifications
- `ErrorManager`: Unified error handling
- `Logger`: Persistent logging system

**ViewModels:**
- `AppState`: Global app state
- `StorageSwitcherViewModel`: Storage switching logic
- `SetupWizardViewModel`: First-time setup
- Others inline in views

**Views:**
- `QuickLauncherView`: App launcher
- `AppManagementView`: Install/uninstall
- `StorageSwitcherView`: Storage switching
- `VolumeListView`: Volume management
- `SettingsView`: App settings
- `MaintenanceView`: System maintenance
- `SetupWizardView`: First-time setup
- `LogViewerView`: Log viewing

### State Management
- **Global State:** `AppState` singleton with `@Published` properties
- **Local State:** ViewModel per view with `@StateObject`
- **Environment:** `@EnvironmentObject` for cross-view state
- **Persistence:** UserDefaults for settings, JSON for logs

### Concurrency
- **@MainActor:** All ViewModels for UI safety
- **async/await:** Modern Swift concurrency throughout
- **Task { }:** Launch async work from sync context
- **Background:** Shell commands execute off main thread
