## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices
1. **Hybrid Architecture:** SwiftUI UI + existing Zsh backend
   - Reason: Preserve proven CLI logic while modernizing UI
   - Benefit: Faster development, reduced risk

2. **ObservableObject + @Published:** State management
   - Reason: Native SwiftUI pattern
   - Benefit: Reactive UI updates

3. **ShellScriptExecutor Service:** Centralized shell command execution
   - Reason: DRY principle, consistent error handling
   - Benefit: Easy to mock for testing

4. **Lock File:** Single instance control
   - Reason: Prevent multiple app instances
   - Benefit: Avoid conflicts with APFS operations

### UI/UX Decisions
1. **Sidebar Navigation:** Instead of tabs
   - Reason: More macOS-native feel
   - Benefit: Easy to add more sections

2. **Hover Effects:** Scale + shadow animations
   - Reason: Modern, responsive feel
   - Benefit: Clear visual feedback

3. **Storage Mode Color Coding:** Consistent colors
   - Reason: Quick visual identification
   - Benefit: Reduce cognitive load

4. **Progress Animations:** Smooth, spring-based
   - Reason: Professional appearance
   - Benefit: User confidence during long operations

## 📝 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **sudo Operations:** Not yet implemented (Phase 5)
2. **Error Dialogs:** Not unified across app
3. **Testing:** No unit tests yet
4. **Build:** Not tested on macOS yet
5. **Performance:** Not optimized yet

### Technical Debt
1. Some ViewModels defined inline in views (should be extracted)
2. SettingsViewModel accessed in multiple places (should use singleton or inject)
3. Sample data fallbacks throughout (remove in production)
4. Missing input validation in some places
5. No proper error codes/enum (using NSError strings)

### Future Enhancements
1. App icon and assets
2. Menu bar app option
3. Quick actions from Dock
4. Spotlight integration
5. Dark mode refinements
6. Localization (Japanese, English)
7. Crash reporting
8. Analytics (optional, privacy-focused)
